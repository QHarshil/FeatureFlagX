# FeatureFlagX Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and considerations for the FeatureFlagX service and SDKs. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your feature flag implementation remains secure in production environments.

## API Security

### Authentication and Authorization

The FeatureFlagX API should be secured with proper authentication and authorization:

1. **API Keys**: Use API keys for SDK authentication
   - Store API keys securely using environment variables
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Use different keys for different environments

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Admin role: Full access to create, update, and delete flags
   - Developer role: Read access to all flags, create and update access to development flags
   - Service role: Read-only access for evaluation endpoints

3. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Implement JWT for user authentication
   - Include proper expiration times
   - Validate tokens on each request

### Transport Security

1. **HTTPS Only**:
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Configure proper TLS/SSL settings
   - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - Use trusted certificates
   - Monitor certificate expiration
   - Implement certificate rotation

### Input Validation

1. **Request Validation**:
   - Validate all input parameters
   - Sanitize user input
   - Implement request size limits

2. **Content Security**:
   - Set appropriate Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Validate content types
   - Prevent XSS attacks

## SDK Security

### Secure Communication

1. **HTTPS Enforcement**:
   - SDKs should enforce HTTPS by default
   - Provide option to disable only in development

2. **Connection Pooling**:
   - Implement connection pooling for efficiency
   - Set appropriate timeouts

### Data Handling

1. **Local Caching**:
   - Cache data securely
   - Don't cache sensitive information
   - Implement proper TTL

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
   - Log securely
   - Fail securely

### Configuration

1. **Secure Defaults**:
   - Implement secure defaults
   - Require explicit opt-out for less secure options

2. **Environment Awareness**:
   - Detect and adapt to environment (dev/test/prod)
   - Apply stricter security in production

## Operational Security

### Logging and Monitoring

1. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all administrative actions
   - Include user, action, timestamp, and IP
   - Store logs securely

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns
   - Track usage metrics

### Rate Limiting

1. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Use different limits for different endpoints
   - Include rate limit headers

2. **Backoff Strategy**:
   - Implement exponential backoff in SDKs
   - Handle rate limit responses gracefully

### Deployment Security

1. **Container Security**:
   - Use minimal base images
   - Run as non-root user
   - Scan for vulnerabilities

2. **Secret Management**:
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Consider a secret management service
   - Don't hardcode secrets

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy

1. **Personal Data**:
   - Minimize collection of personal data
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Consider GDPR and other privacy regulations

2. **Data Segregation**:
   - Separate flag configuration from user data
   - Implement proper access controls

### Audit and Compliance

1. **Audit Trail**:
   - Maintain comprehensive audit logs
   - Preserve logs for required retention periods
   - Ensure logs are tamper-proof

2. **Compliance Reporting**:
   - Generate compliance reports
   - Document security measures

## Security Testing

1. **Automated Security Testing**:
   - Include security tests in CI/CD
   - Perform regular vulnerability scanning
   - Implement SAST and DAST

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Conduct regular penetration tests
   - Address findings promptly
   - Document test results

## Incident Response

1. **Security Incident Plan**:
   - Document incident response procedures
   - Define roles and responsibilities
   - Practice incident response

2. **Vulnerability Disclosure**:
   - Implement a responsible disclosure policy
   - Provide a security contact
   - Acknowledge and address reported vulnerabilities
