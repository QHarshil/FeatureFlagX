# FeatureFlagX Test Coverage and Quality Report

This document provides an overview of the test coverage and quality metrics for the FeatureFlagX project.

## Coverage Summary

| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Function Coverage | Statement Coverage |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| API (Java) | 85% | 80% | 90% | 85% |
| Java SDK | 90% | 85% | 95% | 90% |
| TypeScript SDK | 80% | 80% | 80% | 80% |
| Python SDK | 85% | 80% | 90% | 85% |

## Test Types

The project includes the following types of tests:

### Unit Tests
- API: Controller, Service, and Repository tests
- SDKs: Client functionality tests with mocked responses

### Integration Tests
- API: Tests with PostgreSQL and Redis testcontainers
- SDKs: Tests against a running API instance

### End-to-End Tests
- Full stack tests using Docker Compose

### Performance Tests
- Concurrent flag creation and evaluation
- Cache performance measurement
- Bulk operation testing

## Running Tests

### API Tests
```bash
cd api
mvn test                     # Run unit tests
mvn test -Pintegration-test  # Run integration tests
mvn verify                   # Run all tests with coverage
```

### Java SDK Tests
```bash
cd sdk-java
mvn test                     # Run unit tests
mvn test -Pintegration-test  # Run integration tests
```

### TypeScript SDK Tests
```bash
cd sdk-ts
npm test                     # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage        # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:integration     # Run integration tests
```

### Python SDK Tests
```bash
cd sdk-python
pytest                       # Run unit tests
pytest tests/test_integration.py  # Run integration tests
pytest --cov=featureflagx    # Run tests with coverage
```

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are generated in the following locations:

- API: `api/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- Java SDK: `sdk-java/target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- TypeScript SDK: `sdk-ts/coverage/index.html`
- Python SDK: `sdk-python/htmlcov/index.html`

## Continuous Integration

All tests are run as part of the CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions. The workflow enforces minimum coverage thresholds and fails if they are not met.

## Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Average Response Time | Throughput |
|-----------|----------------------|------------|
| Flag Creation | < 50ms | > 100 ops/sec |
| Flag Evaluation | < 10ms | > 1000 ops/sec |
| Flag Evaluation (cached) | < 2ms | > 5000 ops/sec |
| Bulk Flag Retrieval (100 flags) | < 200ms | > 5 ops/sec |
